Scribble 0.4
---

- Modified scribblec script interface: check

    ./scribblec --help
    
  for new usages.  
  
- The core tooling has been refactored to use a new validation method.  To
  obtain more details on errors, use the -V command line flag.

  N.B. the -oldwf command line flag uses the simpler syntactic protocol
  well-formedness from the previous version of tool only.  Warning: no 
  guarantees are offered when validating newer Scribble features using -oldwf.
  
- Most Scribble demos that were previously in 

    modules/core/src/test/scrib/demo
  
  have been relocated to 
 
    modules/demos/scrib/
    
  Some demo files have also been renamed or repackaged.
